I began my academic career with an Bachelor's degree in Oceanography, from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Throughout my B.Sc, I studied marine macroalgae, investigating how they respond to environmental stressors through ecophysiological experiments. In my Senior thesis, I started to work with species distribution models, and I became really interested in what determines the geographical distribution of species. I am now completing a Master's in Ecology at the same University, and I am assessing the vulnerability of Brazilian rhodolith beds (calcareous red algae) to global (ocean warming and acidification) and local stressors (increased nutrient runoff), using physiological and SDM tools.

I am greatly interested in niche theory, and often catch myself thinking about all the dimensions of a species' niche and how it can change throughout time. I am also interested in understanding the impacts of climate change on populations and the dynamics of communities. I completed my PhD in 2025, which focused on modelling the distributions of mosses in Antarctica. I am now doing a brief stint as a postdoc before moving onto a new position in Switzerland.
