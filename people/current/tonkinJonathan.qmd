My academic journey has taken me around the world, from New Zealand to China (lecturer) to Germany (postdoc) to the USA (postdoc) and back to New Zealand.

I started with a PhD at [Massey University](http://www.massey.ac.nz/) in New Zealand working with Russell Death, Mike Joy, and Kevin Collier looking at the interaction between productivity and disturbance on structuring stream invertebrate diversity patterns. I followed that up with a job teaching Environmental Management and Marine Studies at [Bay of Plenty Polytechnic](http://www.boppoly.ac.nz/) in Tauranga, New Zealand. I then spent one exciting year at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/) in Suzhou, China lecturing in Environmental Science. I followed that up with two years at [Senckenberg](http://www.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=71) Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Germany, based in the River Ecology and Conservation [Department](http://www.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=5217&organisation=true&institutID=1&abteilungID=26) in the lovely little town of Gelnhausen, where I worked with Peter Haase and Sonja Jaehnig. I then moved to the USA to spend three fantastic years at <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University</a> in Corvallis, Oregon working with [Dave Lytle](https://lytlelab.science.oregonstate.edu/). Finally, I managed to land a postdoc with [Jason Tylianakis](https://www.tylianakislab.org/) at [the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/), which I cut short due to receiving a [Rutherford Discovery Fellowship](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/rutherford-discovery-fellowships/) ([project summary](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/rutherford-discovery-fellowships/rutherford-discovery-fellowship-recipients/new-rsnz-content-2)).
