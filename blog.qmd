This blog is a collection of posts by the lab. It is intended to keep you abreast of our research. If you'd like a weekly dose of insight on the biodiversity-climate nexus and water resource management, please sign up to Jono's newsletter 'Predirections'. It's a mix of science (including some of our own), policy and personal reflections on the state of the world, with a focus on **solutions**. It's a great way to keep up to date with the latest research and thinking in the field. You can sign up [here](https://predirections.substack.com) or enter your email below.
