This is an emerging interest for the group, and we are excited to be working on it. We are motivated to translate our research to on-the-ground solutions. By working in interdisciplinary teams, we can leverage our expertise to address complex problems. Our association with [Te PÅ«naha Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/) has been instrumental in fostering these collaborations.
