Our research is increasingly forward looking. We develop models to forecast how biodiversity will respond to unprecedented changes associated with climate change, as well as how human intervention might influence biodiversity in a future world. Mechanistic models are one tool for this approach (see [population models](/research/interests/popModels)), particularly if looking over the longer-term. However, other approaches exist to predict near-term dynamics, particularly where mechanistic data are lacking. For instance, hybrid models can leverage the availability of both mechanistic and correlative data, including integrated population models, hierarchical models, and inverse modelling approaches. These approaches ‘borrow strength’, fill gaps, and fuse data to get the best from different forms of data. Over the coming years, we will be employing many of these approaches to forecast biodiversity responses to novel environmental change, particularly for Antarctic species, as part of the Antarctic Science Platform. 

Modelling approaches based on past correlations do poorly looking into the future for how species may respond to unprecedented changes. By explicitly modelling the biology underpinning the distribution of species rather than correlating the presence of species with particular conditions, mechanistic models offer a greater capacity to forecast species responses to novel combinations of environmental conditions. We develop mechanistic (or process-based) population models that link population dynamics with environmental variability, including matrix population models and time-varying logistic growth models. We also develop approaches to link population models together in a community-wide framework that enables an understanding of community dynamics under various future conditions. These are typically focused on river ecosystems by linking river flow regimes with invertebrates, fish and riparian plants, but we are expanding into new ecosystems, including the Antarctic.
