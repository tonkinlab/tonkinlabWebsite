We are always on the lookout for motivated students and postdocs to join the group. If you’ve had a look around our website and you’re interested in working with us, please do get in touch. Likewise, if you have an idea for a project, [get in touch](mailto:jonathan.tonkin@canterbury.ac.nz) and include a brief introduction of your experience, research interests and goals.

If we don't currently have any funded opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, we very much welcome inquiries. If you're interested in joining the group, please do get in touch with Jono with an outline of your proposed research and a CV. Funding for postdocs in New Zealand is pretty limited, so it may be best to seek funding from your home country. Jono can help put together a proposal for external funding. Any positions that do come available will be clearly advertised.

We have a range of possible postgraduate degrees available, including BSc Hons, MSc and PhD (details [here](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/postgraduate-study/)). Motivated individuals wishing to join our group as a PhD, Masters or Honours student are encouraged to email me, including a CV and a description of background and research interests. The University of Canterbury offers doctoral scholarships twice a year -- deadlines generally fall in mid-May and mid-October (details can be found [here](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/scholarshipsearch/ScholarshipDetails.aspx?ScholarshipID=6935.127)). If you are interested in applying, please email Jono well in advance so that we can discuss fit, potential projects, and the application process. There are also a number of other scholarships available that are detailed [here](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/postgraduate-study/), but I'd also encourage you to explore funding opportunities in your own country. Finally, take a look around our department [website](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/), we have a number of great ecologists in the department that could act as co-supervisors.

## Undergraduate students

If you are a current University of Canterbury undergraduate student interested in gaining research experience or conducting a summer research project, please get in touch to discuss opportunities.

## Christchurch, New Zealand

There are not many places in the world where you can go for a surf in the morning and follow it up for a snowboard in the afternoon. Christchurch is one of these places. If you're into the outdoors, it's a bit of a wonderland. In addition to surf and snowboarding/skiing, there is world class hiking, fishing, bouldering etc. all within an hour or two drive. Thus, amazing field sites are equally accessible, including several University of Canterbury [Field Stations](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/life/facilities/field/) (Cass is 1.5 hr away) and a diverse range of montane landscapes and riverscapes.
