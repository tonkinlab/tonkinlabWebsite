<p><i>We tackle fundamental questions in ecology, including how populations and communities vary in space & time, how they resist and recover from change, and how they might look in a future world. We combine theory and experiments with data analysis and synthesis. We apply this knowledge to real-world problems to find solutions to the global biodiversity crisis and to prepare ecosystems for an uncertain future.

**Oct. 2020 » Bio-Protection Aotearoa and Te Pūnaha Matatini funded for eight years.** Last week, the next round of NZ Centres of Research Excellence were announced. Jono is delighted that two of the CoREs he is involved in have been funded for the next eight years: Bio-Protection Aotearoa and Te Pūnaha Matatini. There will be new positions advertised here in the coming months.

**Sept. 2020 » Paper accepted in Global Change Biology.** Jono has just had a co-authored paper on taxonomic homogenisation but functional differentiation among stream macroinvertebrate assemblages under climate change. This effort was led by Théophile Mouton. More soon.

**Aug 2020 » Paper accepted in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.** Jono has just had a paper on designing flow regimes to support entire river ecosystems accepted for publication in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. More soon.

**Oct 2019 » Permanent position.** Jono received the news that he has a permanent position at the University of Canterbury in the fabulous School of Biological Sciences. He's delighted to get to set down roots and build a flourishing research lab in his home country of New Zealand.

**Sept 2019 » New Tonkin Lab website.** Welcome to the new-look Tonkin Lab website. Keep your eyes peeled for upcoming opportunities to join the lab.

**June 2019 » New paper in Nature.** Our paper on preparing river ecosystems for an uncertain future came out in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01877-1). It was a real treat to work with such a great group of colleagues on this one: LeRoy Poff, Dave Lytle, Julian Olden, Nick Bond, Avril Horne, Albert Ruhi, Lindsay Reynolds and Dave Merritt.

**April 2019 » New paper in Ecosphere.** We have a new paper out in [Ecosphere](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2681). This is a multi-species demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes in the Verde River, Arizona. Projecting the model beyond the survey data predicted a shift from a native dominant to a nonnative dominant community, which was linked to increasing drought frequency. Thanks very much for leading this effort, Jane!

**Dec 2018 » Paper accepted in Sci. Tot. Env.** We just had a paper accepted led by Peter Haase, Francesca Pilotto and Fengqing Li. This has been a long road, so it's nice to see it through review. The title gives the central result: Moderate warming over the past 25 years has already reorganized stream invertebrate communities.

**Dec 2018 » Paper accepted in River Research and Applications.** We just had a paper accepted on: The three Rs of river ecosystem resilience: Resources, Recruitment and Refugia. Thanks to Kris Van Looy for leading this. This originated at a workshop in Berlin back in 2015, so it's nice to see it come through in the end.

**Dec 2018 » Awarded the inaugural NZFSS Early Career Researcher Award.** Last week, Jono received the inaugural Early Career Researcher Award by the New Zealand Freshwater Sciences Society. Jono is very grateful to both the Society for giving him the award and the many colleagues that have helped him to get where he is today. It meant he got to share his past few years of research with the society by way of a keynote address.

**Oct 2018 » Awarded a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship.** Jono is delighted and honoured to receive a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship from the Royal Society of New Zealand Te Apārangi. The title of his 5-year programme is "Rethinking ecological networks in changing environments". The fellowship will allow him to build his research programme here in New Zealand after several years overseas, and provide the time to tackle major environmental challenges in a way that is not necessarily possible over shorter timescales.
