  We are an [interdisciplinary]{.fw-bolder} research group based within the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.ku.edu){.text-primary .text-decoration-none .fw-semibold} at the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu). We develop, validate, and apply [computational methods]{.fw-bolder} to advance the study of [emotion]{.fw-bolder}, [interpersonal communication]{.fw-bolder}, and [mental health]{.fw-bolder}.

:::
We tackle fundamental questions in ecology, including... <br> ... how populations and communities vary in space & time <br> ... how they resist and recover from change <br> ... and how they might look in a future world. <br> <br> We apply this knowledge to real-world problems to find solutions to the global biodiversity crisis and to prepare ecosystems for an uncertain future. <br> <br> We are particularly enamoured with freshwater ecosystems, but our research spans disciplinary and ecological boundaries.
