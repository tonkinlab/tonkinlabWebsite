image-title: "Ecological mechanisms are increasingly important in Antarctic biodiversity forecasts. (A) The Antarctic Peninsula is a hotbed for the arrival of
invasive species (points represent known distribution of non-native species), creating novel biotic interactions for resident biota. (B) Demographic
models are increasingly being applied to understand responses of different penguin life stages to climate change (gentoo penguins pictured). (C) Remote
sensing using hyperspectral imaging identifies locations with high concentrations of microbial mats in stream channels in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (colours represent
band absorption identifying high concentrations of microbial mats). (D) Sampling to understand the genetic variation of soil communities on Deception Island. (E) Dynamic Energy Budget models are one way to incorporate physiology into forecasts (here of the limpet Nacella concinna). (F) Dispersal is an important
mechanism under climate change with the kelp Durvillaea antarctica (pictured) increasingly reaching Antarctica. Photos reproduced with permission from

<br>Antarctic ecosystems are under increasing anthropogenic pressure, but efforts to predict the responses of Antarctic biodiversity to environmental change are hindered by considerable data challenges. Here, we illustrate how novel data capture technologies provide exciting opportunities to sample Antarctic biodiversity at wider spatiotemporal scales. Data integration frameworks, such as point process and hierarchical models, can mitigate weaknesses in individual data sets, improving confidence in their predictions. Increasing process knowledge in models is imperative to achieving improved forecasts of Antarctic biodiversity, which can be attained for data-limited species using hybrid modelling frameworks. Leveraging these state-of-the-art tools will help to overcome many of the data scarcity challenges presented by the remoteness of Antarctica, enabling more robust forecasts both near- and long-term.
